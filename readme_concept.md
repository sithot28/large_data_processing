To address the issue of a rapidly growing table and slow query performance in your core insurance system, you can implement a combination of architectural and database optimization techniques. Here are detailed suggestions:

### 1. **Partitioning the Table**
   - **Why?** Partitioning splits the table into smaller, more manageable chunks based on a defined criterion (e.g., date, customer status).
   - **How?**
     - Use **PostgreSQL native partitioning** to partition the table by `month` or `status` (e.g., active/inactive).
     - When inserting data, PostgreSQL will automatically route it to the correct partition.
     - Queries that filter by partition keys (e.g., date) will only scan relevant partitions, improving performance.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE customers (
         id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         customer_id UUID NOT NULL,
         status TEXT NOT NULL,
         created_at DATE NOT NULL
     ) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

     CREATE TABLE customers_jan2024 PARTITION OF customers FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
     CREATE TABLE customers_feb2024 PARTITION OF customers FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');
     ```

### 2. **Archival Strategy**
   - **Why?** Data older than one month is no longer active and shouldn't affect everyday operations.
   - **How?**
     - Move inactive customer data to a separate **archival database** or table periodically (e.g., a nightly cron job).
     - Use tools like `pg_dump` to export old data and `pg_restore` for recovery when needed.
     - Retain only essential fields in the active table for faster queries.

### 3. **Index Optimization**
   - **Why?** Proper indexing reduces query scan time.
   - **How?**
     - Create indexes on frequently queried columns, such as `customer_id`, `created_at`, or `status`.
     - Use **partial indexes** to index only active customers:
       ```sql
       CREATE INDEX idx_active_customers ON customers (customer_id) WHERE status = 'active';
       ```

### 4. **Materialized Views for Reporting**
   - **Why?** Complex reports can be generated periodically instead of querying the main table repeatedly.
   - **How?**
     - Use materialized views to precompute and store results for commonly used reports.
     - Refresh views during non-peak hours.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW active_customers_summary AS
       SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS total
       FROM customers
       WHERE status = 'active'
       GROUP BY status;
       ```
       To refresh:
       ```sql
       REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW active_customers_summary;
       ```

---

### 5. **Implement Table Cleanup Policies**
   - **Why?** To ensure the table size remains manageable.
   - **How?**
     - Use PostgreSQL's **pg_cron** or an external scheduler to delete or archive rows older than 1 month:
       ```sql
       DELETE FROM customers WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month';
       ```

---

### 6. **Optimize Data Loading**
   - **Why?** Bulk data inserts can cause performance bottlenecks.
   - **How?**
     - Use **COPY command** or batch inserts for loading the 1,000,000 daily rows:
       ```sql
       COPY customers FROM '/path/to/data.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv);
       ```
     - Disable indexes and constraints during bulk inserts and re-enable afterward to improve speed.

---

### 7. **Scaling with Sharding**
   - **Why?** If the table grows beyond the capabilities of a single PostgreSQL instance.
   - **How?**
     - Use sharding tools like **Citus** (open-source PostgreSQL extension) to distribute data across multiple nodes.

---

### 8. **Monitoring and Query Optimization**
   - **Why?** Identifying slow queries helps refine your approach.
   - **How?**
     - Enable `pg_stat_statements` to analyze query performance:
       ```sql
       CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
       ```
     - Identify slow queries and optimize their execution plans.

---

### Suggested Combination
1. Start with **partitioning** and **archival** to manage table size.
2. Use **indexes** and **materialized views** for faster queries and reporting.
3. Automate table cleanup and archival processes with a job scheduler.
