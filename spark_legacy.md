Apache Spark can be a powerful addition to your architecture, especially if you're dealing with large-scale data processing and reporting challenges. Here's how Spark fits into solving the problems of managing and querying massive datasets in your core insurance system:

---

### **Where Spark Fits**
1. **Batch Processing for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**
   - Spark excels at processing large volumes of data. You can use it to:
     - Process the 1,000,000 daily new customer records in parallel.
     - Transform the data (e.g., filtering inactive users, calculating metrics).
     - Load processed data back into the PostgreSQL database or an archival system.
   - **Why Spark?**
     - It's highly scalable and processes data orders of magnitude faster than PostgreSQL for large datasets.

2. **Archival and Historical Data Management:**
   - Move inactive customer data to distributed storage systems like Hadoop HDFS, AWS S3, or Azure Blob Storage.
   - Use Spark to query archived data directly from the storage layer, avoiding PostgreSQL table bloat.
   - **Example Workflow:**
     - Use Spark to extract and transform expired data from PostgreSQL.
     - Save the data to Parquet/ORC formats, which are efficient for storage and querying.

3. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - Run complex reporting queries on Spark using **Spark SQL**, bypassing the need to query PostgreSQL for historical or aggregated data.
   - Generate reports or dashboards directly from Spark outputs, feeding tools like Tableau, Power BI, or custom visualization tools.

4. **Real-Time Streaming for Active Customers:**
   - Use **Spark Streaming** or **Structured Streaming** for real-time processing of active customer events, like policy updates or claim activities.
   - Maintain a separate "real-time" dataset for active customers in memory or a fast NoSQL database like Redis or Cassandra.

### **How to Integrate Spark with Your System**
1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Use Spark to read daily customer uploads directly from source files (e.g., CSV, JSON, or database).
   - Example Spark Job to ingest data:
     ```python
     from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

     spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CustomerETL").getOrCreate()

     # Read data
     new_customers = spark.read.csv("s3://bucket/customers.csv", header=True)

     # Transform data
     filtered_customers = new_customers.filter(new_customers.status == "active")

     # Write to PostgreSQL
     filtered_customers.write.format("jdbc") \
         .option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database") \
         .option("dbtable", "customers") \
         .option("user", "username") \
         .option("password", "password") \
         .save()
     ```

2. **Query and Analytics:**
   - Load data from PostgreSQL and archived storage into Spark for analytics.
   - Example for querying archived data:
     ```python
     archived_data = spark.read.parquet("s3://bucket/archived-customers/")
     active_summary = archived_data.groupBy("status").count()
     active_summary.show()
     ```

3. **Distributed Query Execution:**
   - Use Spark SQL for large-scale queries that would otherwise be slow on PostgreSQL:
     ```python
     spark.sql("SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE created_at >= '2024-12-01' GROUP BY status").show()
     ```

4. **Integration with PostgreSQL:**
   - Use Spark to offload heavy computations from PostgreSQL.
   - Synchronize results back to PostgreSQL for lightweight query use cases.

### **When to Use Spark**
- **Volume:** Your data size is growing beyond PostgreSQL's practical limits for single-table operations.
- **Performance:** You need faster batch processing, ETL, and analytics for large datasets.
- **Scalability:** You expect data to grow substantially, and you need a horizontally scalable solution.
- **Archival and Reporting:** You want to separate analytical workloads from transactional operations.

---

### **Complementary Architecture**
1. **Use PostgreSQL for:**
   - Real-time transactional operations.
   - Storing and querying active customers.
   - Lightweight ad-hoc queries.

2. **Use Spark for:**
   - Heavy ETL processing (e.g., loading, transforming, and archiving).
   - Running complex analytical queries.
   - Managing and querying historical data.

3. **Storage Backend:**
   - Archive historical data to HDFS, S3, or similar.
   - Use formats like Parquet/ORC for efficient storage and Spark compatibility.

4. **Streaming (Optional):**
   - Handle real-time updates and events using Spark Streaming.
